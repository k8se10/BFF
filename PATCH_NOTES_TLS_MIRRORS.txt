Applied TLS/repository resilience patch for mixinextras resolution.

Changes:
- Updated settings.gradle
Updated build.gradle repositories
Updated gradle.properties
Created .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Added mirrors: ladysnake, quilt, terraformers, sponge.
- Forced IPv4 and TLS1.2/1.3 via gradle.properties and workflow env.

If resolution still fails intermittently, re-run the job; caching sometimes holds a bad edge result.
